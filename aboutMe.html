                    <p>Coding is pretty brand new for me even though i have known about it a while ago, i was unable to practice because my laptop wasn't the best till now, im mostly of the time practicing with an App called Mimo, but its nothing compared to actually doing something like this Portfolio! <br><br> Im open for working straight away in something related to IT <br><br> --> <a class="item-nav link" href="Professional Resume.pdf">My Resume</a></p>
