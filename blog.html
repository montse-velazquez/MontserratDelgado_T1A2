                <div class="username">@montsevelazquezz <br>Nov 22</div>
                <div class="bio"> Won the first place of the Alan Turing Contest on March 2022, the competition consisted
                    in 6 questions about printing different figures in base of equations, by using Python, it went from printing figures like "x" with x and y number to
                    booleans values if the point was in the right or left of a function. <br><br> It was my very first time coding outside of Mimo, freeCodeCamp and others, so it was a great achievement for me to won the competition.

                <div class="bio"> Since i got here i have met so much people from everywhere, places, life. My life have changed so much and even myself, each day i get more passionated about coding, about to challenge myself everyday to make better projects, sometimes it's overwhelming however the satisfaction of running your code and seeing what you created by zero, it worth everything! <br><br> I spent so much time in this project, that im even impressed myself about how well it went after all, it can be not the best for now but it will.

                <div class="bio">I want to live of coding, the fact that nowdays you are able to do so many things from wehrever you are, and that now coding from a laptop is easier, it makes it even more excited. I'm so focused on getting better each day, because i know i would get in there soon if i keep pushing myself just a bit more, once i read that it doesn matter if you just improve 0.1% per day, as long as you improve its okay, because after 100 days it will become a 10% and so on and we will start looking at the changes, and os then it woul dhave worth every 0.1% that we tought it didnt really matter. 
                    <br><br> 
                    Everyday it doesnt matter if i couldn't achieve my whole page as long as i got some of it, it already made a change for the next time.

                <div class="username">@montsevelazquezz<br>Nov 22</div>
                <div class="bio"> I'm usually reading Sci-Fi books rather than others, however i started findig slef-development books pretty useful, not saying that they are not but never really took the time for reading those till now, im reading Atomic Habits by James Clear.
                    <br><br>
                    In the book it talks about how for making changes we need a systems not a goal for achieving those results. It made me think about it when doing this project, because for doing it i follow a system, which was study all back again, plan design, set a list of what it's more important, color, design, animation, etc.
                    It helped me for setting time and objectives, the practice of each day made me realize about more thing eventually making them easier and easier everytime.

                <div class="username">@montsevelazquezz<br>Dec 22</div>
                <div class="bio"> Thank you for all the core memories i recollected this year, so far this has been the best year of my life, full of new experience, concerts, places, people, living in a whole new country that is more tahn 14,000 km far from where i grew up, far from all my family and friends. 
                    <br><br>
                    I learnt so many things this year, i lost and found myself in the road, it helped me a lot to focused on me, and to find where i really want to be and what i want to do with my life, i had to take so many decisions this year, sometimes i was not even sure about what i was doing, not all my decisions are the greatest ones, but i have learned from my mistakes. 2022 you were surreal i will never forget you, you leave a big mark on me.
